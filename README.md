# Frontend Mentor Challeges...

These are just challenges that I am working on to improve my frontend development skills. Each project is a solution to a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). You can find my implementations, code, and live demos in the respective folders.

## Challenges

- **[Project 1: Product Preview Card Component ](./0_Product_Preview_Card_Component/)**

- **[Project 2: Recipe Page](./1_Recipe_Page/)**

- **[Project 3: Still working] (./2_Blog_Preview_Card)**

Check each folder for a README with more details, screenshots, and live demo links.


Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback!
